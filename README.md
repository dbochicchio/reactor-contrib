My contrib to [MS Reactor](https://reactor.toggledbits.com/docs/).
I love Reactor, because it's a very powerful logic engine for Home Automation, and has the ability to aggregate all your controllers in a unified logic engine.
It's both visual and code based, so it's the perfect balance to write complex automations.

# Controllers
- [reactor-opensprinkler](https://github.com/dbochicchio/reactor-opensprinkler): MSR controller for OpenSprinkler
- [reactor-espresense](https://github.com/dbochicchio/reactor-espresense): MSR controller for ESPresense
- [reactor-lgtv](https://github.com/dbochicchio/reactor-lgtv): MSR controller for LG TVs

# Other contributions:
- [reactor-mqtt-contrib](https://github.com/dbochicchio/reactor-mqtt-contrib): additional template for MSR MQTT controller.
